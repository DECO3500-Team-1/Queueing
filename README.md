The prototype v2.0 is provided here, which can be downloaded and run without having to compile 
existing project files. The project files were too large and were to numerous to manually upload
due to a lack of existing organic connections between Unity and GitHub. In order to run, the user
has to download UnityPlayer.dll, which was one of the files to large to upload. 

The prototype v2.0 was a further development of the original v1.0 by adding aesthetic changes and 
an addition of cooperative functionality such as a shared scoreboard. These improvements were done
in response to user feedback in the first trade show.
